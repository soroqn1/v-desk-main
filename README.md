# v-desk-main

## Setup and Launch

To quickly set up the project (clone or update backend and frontend repositories), use the `setup.sh` script:

```bash
# Make the script executable (if needed)
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the setup
./setup.sh
```

This script automatically pulls the latest code versions from the following repositories:
- Frontend: \`https://github.com/soroqn1/v-desk-web.git\`
- Backend: \`https://github.com/soroqn1/v-desk-api.git\`
